I developed a neural network model for the MNIST dataset using PyTorch, consisting of three fully connected layers with ReLU activation for a Udacity's ML Nanodegree.
The overall test loss of the model was 6.82, achieving high accuracy for most of the diggits. 
However, after making adjustments to the model, the test loss increased to 11.62 and while for digit 4 it achieved 100% accuracy, the accuracy for other digits significantly dropped, indicating that the model's changes negatively impacted its generalization.
